## Mastering the field of computer networking is equivalent to understanding the what, why, and how of networking protocols
## On one hand, it is unfortunate that the physical laws of reality introduce delay and loss as well as constrain throughput. On the other hand, because computer networks have these problems, there are many fascinating issues surrounding how to deal with the problems—more than enough issues to fill a course on computer networking and to motivate thousands of PhD theses!
## In fact, queuing delay is so important and interesting in computer networking that thousands of papers and numerous books have been written about it [Bertsekas 1991; Kleinrock 1975, Kleinrock 1976].

### our experience as instructors (and that of many instructors who have used this text) has been that teaching networking applications near the beginning of the course is a powerful motivational tool. Students are thrilled to learn about how networking applications work—applications such as e-mail, streaming video and the Web, which most students use on a daily basis. Once a student understands the applications, the student can then understand the network services needed to support these applications. The student can then, in turn, examine the various ways in which such services might be provided and implemented in the lower layers. Covering applications early thus provides motivation for the remainder of the text.

TODO: Software-defined networking 

TODO: Students not only see how popular applications and protocols work, but also learn how easy it is to create their own network applications and application-layer protocols

TODO: Programming assignments. The Website also provides a number of detailed
programming assignments, which include building a multithreaded Web server,
building an e-mail client with a GUI interface, programming the sender and
receiver sides of a reliable data transport protocol, programming a distributed
routing algorithm, and more.   


TODO: Wireshark labs. One’s understanding of network protocols can be greatly
deepened by seeing them in action. The Website provides numerous Wireshark
assignments that enable students to actually observe the sequence of messages
exchanged between two protocol entities. The Website includes separate Wire-
shark labs on HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, Ethernet, ARP, WiFi, TLS and
on tracing all protocols involved in satisfying a request to fetch a Web page. We’ll
continue to add new labs over time

TODO: We also encourage instructors and students to create new interactive animations
that illustrate the concepts and protocols in this book. If you have an animation that
you think would be appropriate for this text, please submit it to us. If the animation
(including notation and terminology) is appropriate, we’ll be happy to include it on
the text’s Website, with an appropriate reference to the animation’s authors.

TODO: So, as the saying goes, “Keep those cards and letters coming!” Seriously, please
do continue to send us interesting URLs, point out typos, disagree with any of our
claims, and tell us what works and what doesn’t work. Tell us what you think should
or shouldn’t be included in the next edition. Send your e-mail to kurose@cs.umass
.edu and keithwross@nyu.edu.
