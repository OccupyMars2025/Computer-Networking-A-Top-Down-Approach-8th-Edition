## TODO: Software-defined networking
## TODO: Students not only see how popular applications and protocols work, but also learn how easy it is to create their own network applications and application-layer protocols

TODO: Programming assignments. The Website also provides a number of detailed
programming assignments, which include building a multithreaded Web server,
building an e-mail client with a GUI interface, programming the sender and
receiver sides of a reliable data transport protocol, programming a distributed
routing algorithm, and more.
• Wireshark labs. One’s understanding of network protocols can be greatly
deepened by seeing them in action. The Website provides numerous Wireshark
assignments that enable students to actually observe the sequence of messages
exchanged between two protocol entities. The Website includes separate Wire-
shark labs on HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, Ethernet, ARP, WiFi, TLS and
on tracing all protocols involved in satisfying a request to fetch a Web page. We’ll
continue to add new labs over time

### our experience as instructors (and that of many instructors who have used this text) has been that teaching networking applications near the beginning of the course is a powerful motivational tool. Students are thrilled to learn about how networking applications work—applications such as e-mail, streaming video and the Web, which most students use on a daily basis. Once a student understands the applications, the student can then understand the network services needed to support these applications. The student can then, in turn, examine the various ways in which such services might be provided and implemented in the lower layers. Covering applications early thus provides motivation for the remainder of the text.
