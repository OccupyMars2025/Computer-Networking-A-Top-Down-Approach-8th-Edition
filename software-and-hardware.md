## How would you like to see a real HTTP response message? 
```

telnet gaia.cs.umass.edu 80
GET /kurose_ross/interactive/index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: gaia.cs.umass.edu

```
(Press the carriage return twice after typing the last line.) This opens a TCP con-
nection to port 80 of the host gaia.cs.umass.edu and then sends the HTTP
request message. You should see a response message that includes the base HTML
file for the interactive homework problems for this textbook. If youâ€™d rather just see
the HTTP message lines and not receive the object itself, replace GET with HEAD
